# Shortest_path_algorithms
Prim's and Djikstra's algorithm


After the code is run:
The code asks for input file path from the user. A file path in the form of string is then expected
from the user. (eg: venv/Scripts/input_test.txt)
If the specified file is not found. The code then calculates output for the default input file given in
the project.
The code calculates both the shortest path and the minimum spanning tree for the input
automatically.
Input format for txt file:
6 3 U
A B 1
A C 2
B C 1
A
Here:
6 is no of vertices; 3 is no of edges; U is type of edge and A is the source vertex.
10
